In App Billing Documentation
============================

*** This is a fork of https://github.com/poiuytrez/AndroidInAppBilling meant for PhoneGap Build ***

Please see that repo for full documentation.

### USAGE

With this version of the plugin and PhoneGap Build, you must do your own server-side validation as recommended by Google. Purchases are returned to javascript WITHOUT being verified. This allows you NOT to include and distribute your license key.

Returned data now includes the raw JSON data and the signature.
